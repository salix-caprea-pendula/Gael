<h1>About</h1>
Gael is an in-progress visual novel project being written by me in my free time. I have been playing around with the story concepts that are now becoming Gael since sophomore year of college, and am hoping to bring them to fruition over the next few years while combining my programming skils and my passion for music and writing.

<h1>Summary</h1>
Gael's parents say she was born a melancholy soul. Being held could not comfort her, and she would not return the gaze or smiles of her parents. A priest told them that such children did not belong to humanity. Instead they belonged to Yeva, born to serve the Other Creatures. To this end, her parents were happy to send her to the closest monastery as soon as she was apprenticing age.

Unfortunately, the well-being of the Other Creatures is inescapably tied to worldly concerns, as Gael learns during her first two dozen years of service — a part of the job she puts up with begrudgingly in order to gain access to the monastery's vast library and the privilege to travel. 

Colette Auclair, the first daughter of Duke Auclair, is finally of age to be introduced to society. However, three months following exploding onto the aristocratic social scene with a unmatched vivaciousness, she disappears before being pronounced dead. 

A pale, ill-tempered girl arrives at the steps of the monastery with an escort who begs that they house her. After twenty four years of service to Yeva, Gael is forced to take on her only neglected obligation as a member of the order — to raise up an apprentice. 

Meanwhile, long-simmering political turmoil begins to boil over. Are the Other Creatures truly sacred, or should their spiritual importance be overlooked in favor of how they can used in the coming industrial revolution?
